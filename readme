# Project Title

CMPD Traffic stops: To analyze the CMPD traffic stops and create an interactive dashboard by CMPD division.  The dashboard will provide capability to filter data on CMPD division, reason for stop and result of stop, updating all charts accordingly. The dashboard will also allow to choose what parameter to use for the visuals with the counts of traffic stops. 
The data has various other points of interest such as “reason for stop” and several relationships between gender, officer age and whether the search was conducted. The various relationships in data can be visualized through pie charts, bar graphs, maps and timeseries chart. We were able to divide the data up by the divisions and reasons for stop, to make the visuals interesting.
